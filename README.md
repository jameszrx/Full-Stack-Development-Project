# Full-Stack-Development-Project

This is a project focusing on dealing with problems on both frontend and backend.

For the front end, HTML, CSS and JavaScript together with some library (jQuery, Bootstrap) to implement different webpages, here I put the
code of a fully-functional responsive To-Do List page.

For the backend, the technology stack of this project is "MEN" , MongoDB as database, Express as framework, and Node.js as server. In this project, we not only implemented the webpages of Yelpcamp and the route realtion between different pages from scrach, but also built the data connection between database and webpages as well as a authentication system.

This project started in Decemeber 2016 and has been finished in February 2017.
